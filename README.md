# RansomPega
A really old Java ransomware of mine, for archivation purposes.

This Ransomware uses AES 128 Bit encryption, and displays a custom message to the user when the encryption is completed.
Since this ransomware is in Java it is really easy to decompilem unless you use an obfuscator, but this is more like just a POC program.
Please note that this program shouldnt be linked with the Pegasus Spyware by the NSO Group.
